# DATA-STRUCTURE-IN-C-PROGRAM
STAFF ATTENDANCE SYSTEM IN C ( BINARY TREE )

# introduction


In this mini project, we are considering one out of the nine chapters from DCS 2103 Data Structure & Algorithms. The binary tree is a useful data structure for rapidly storing sorted data and rapidly retrieving stored data.
1.	BINARY TREES

a.	RECURSION

•	Recursive take more storage and time than the iterative version.

•	To display all data from staff attendance system by using Inorder Traversal.
b.	STRUCTURE (Records)

•	Can collect the data of the staff attendance.

•	Each field of data can be store and manipulate in order to process large amount of similar data.
c.	LINKED LIST

•	Typically arrangement of data that record from the structure.

•	Appropriate use when the structures are large or need to hold large records.

•	Flexibility is needed also during insertion, deletions and reordering of elements in staff attendance system.

•	Can also using for delete or insert the data to the staff attendance system.
d.	BINARY SEARCH TREE

•	Binary search tree is much important during the checking for status in staff attendance records that save in binary tree.

•	It is important because the system may be stored a lot of data in the system:

	The data maybe large and take large amount of time to accomplish the task.
	For admin accessing the staff information quickly.
	The searching is done recursively until the key value is found.

e.	INORDER TRAVERSAL

•	Inorder traversal is a part binary tree.
•	The data will be shown ascending.
•	Starting from smallest value of staff id to the bigger value.
•	It is also improve the time of access the data.

f.	SORTING

•	Sorting is automatically done in binary tree when staff enter the input in staff attendance system.
•	It is also improve the time of access the data.

•	Without sorting, it will take a longer time to access the information of the staff attendance system in a large database

OUTPUT


















HOMEPAGE

	Have 3 options (‘1’ for Admin Login, ‘2’ for Staff Login, ‘Esc’ for Exit)
	The system scan for the char input only.



















STAFF LOGIN PAGE
	Staff required to enter staff id.

	After user key in the staff id, system will search the staff data is exist or not.
	If staff data has found, the timeout and duration will be update.
	If staff data has not found, the system prompt staff to enter staff name and staff ic.
	The system automatically records the time for the timein and timeout.
